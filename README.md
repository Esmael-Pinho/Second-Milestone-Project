# Design

## Overview
The website consists of three pages home-page, level-page, game-page. The pages are structured in an easy-to-navigate with simple buttons indicating their function allowing visitors to quickly understand the game. The demo button provides a video showing a little demonstration of what the game is and how to play, the play button takes the player, to the levels page with three levels to choose from (easy, medium, hard), upon the player level selection, to the game.


## Color Scheme

  It uses a simple color scheme of Persian-pink and rose , Cherry-blossom and Amethyst with pops of dark-blue and red, along with the primary color.
